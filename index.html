<h1>Auntie Kristin's Story Time</h1>
<p>I like to make people laugh. Fortunately, funny sh*t happens to me all time, and I happen to be a decent story teller.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorites</p>
<h3>Burn It Down</h3>

<h5>This happens to be one of my crown jewels of hilarious stories, but it is kind of long, so strap on your big-girl boots and get ready.</h5>
    <p>Once upon a time, I lived with my roommate Courtney in a craphole apartment for some time after college. One of the ways we were able to cope with 
        our post-college, poverty-induced depression was to host an annual Ugly Christmas Sweater party during the holiday season. We go all out - a required item 
        for entry is not only an unfashionable sweater with a holiday theme, but also a piece of festive headwear. Mine happens to be a headband with two fist-sized
        dreidls hot-glued to it. Go big or go shal-home, I always say. </br></br>
        One year I had been dating my boyfriend Mike for about six months when it was Ugly Sweater time, and it was going well so naturally it was important that his 
        inagural experience at this party be special. He didn't have time to get a sweater, so I went shopping for him, but the pickin's at Goodwill were slim
        by the time I got there. I managed to get a snap-up women's flannel shirt with snowshoes printed on it in addition to a faux-suede vest and some 
        reindeer antlers. These are not extraneous details - we will come back to this momentarily.</br></br>
        Remember that part about going big? I wasn't kidding. This party is not for the faint of liver - we provide Irish-wedding amounts of booze and are not 
        particularly interested in savoring the taste. Mike, to his credit, went all in. By the time it was 11:30, he had consumed an entire 6-pack of 
        Brrrr beer (ever heard of it? Beer with 7.2% alcohol. Look into it.), at least two tall boys, several Peppermint Patty shots, and TWO King's Cups 
        (it's a game where the object is to mix alcohol. Look it up.). Keep in mind that I may have also enjoyed an adult beverage or seven, and also am not
        a babysitter, so this list includes only what I distinctly remember.</br></br>
        Mike was sitting at the table, staring off into space, when all of a sudden he jumped up and ran to the bathroom (my bedroom was the master, so the bathroom
        was in my bedroom). No big deal right? I'd have to pee too if I had just drank a gallon of liquid in less than 3 hours. He came back and sat down after a short time.
        Approximately one minute later, he jumped up and ran to the bathroom again. Now I'm not a rocket surgeon, but I know a symptom of over-intoxication when I see 
        it. I waited a moment, then went to check on him. I knocked on the bathroom door, and the interaction that occured is as follows.</br></br>
        "Mike? How ya doin?"</br>
        "...NO!"</br>
        "Mike? Are you okay? Can I help?"</br>
        *unintelligible grumbling* *sink running* *toilet flush*</br>
        Being the super amzing girlfriend that I am, I decide to be helpful and go get a glass of water and a box of crakers for my puking prince charming. 
        On my way back from the kitchen, I thought to bring a roll of paper towels as well.</br>
        "Mike? I brought you some water and crackers." </br>
        "...NO!"</br>
        "I brought some paper towels too?"</br>"
        The door opened just wide enough that I could see one eye. Mike looked at the roll suspiciously before deciding he could trust it, then grabbed it and
        slammed the door shut before I could blink.</br>
        At this point I figured that the party was over, and I needed to say goodbye to the rest of my guests and let it fizzle out. I politely thanked every for 
        coming by hugging them and slurredly apologizing for getting them drunk, as any good party host would, and then headed back to the bathroom to check on Mike.
        This is where the story really starts to get good, and can really only be told properly through dialogue.</br></br>
        Me: *knocks on bathroom door* "Mike? How's it going? Everyone is gone"</br>
        Mike, through closed bathroom door: "No go away!"</br>
        Me: "Can I help?"</br>
        Mike: "No you can't come in here!"</br>
        Me: "...I kind of think I need to come in there now..."</br>
        Mike: "No you can't come in! It will be fine!"</br>
        Me: "I really think I should come in and help..."</br>
        Mike: "No! It will be fine! Just give me like 5 hours, I'll clean it up! It will be fine, I will clean it up, I just need like 5 hours, it will be fine, I will clean it...
        just give me like... just give me like 6 hours, I'll burn it down! I'll burn it down and buy you a new one! Just like 6 hours, and I can burn it down and buy a new one!"</br>
        Me: "I AM COMING IN RIGHT NOW"</br></br>
        I enter the bathroom and am greeted with what one can only describe as complete and utter Bedlam. Check it out - the things that awaited me fit perfectly in a sweet-ass unordered list!
        <ul>
            <li>There is vomit literally EVERYWHERE except the toilet. On the shower curtain. On the floor. In the sink. On Mike.</li>
            <li>Mike is standing there, on the verge of tears, butt-ass naked EXCEPT FOR THE REINDEER ANTLERS.</li>
            <li>With the exception of the one sock Mike is using to cover his shame, his clothes are in a scrunched up pile behind the door (where he shoved them because he thought I wouldn't find them)</li>
           <li>There is a second scrunched up pile behind the door - turns out it's made from all my bathmats</li>
           <li>The roll of paper towels that I had so thoughtfully provided is sticking up straight up out of the toilet bowl, and the toilet is overflowing.</li>           
        </ul></br>
        Apparently, after Mike threw up all over hell and back, his first thought to clean it up was to use his clothes. When that (surprise) didn't work, his next 
        thought was that the bath mats would do the job. That also didn't work (double surprise), so he finally thought to use the paper towels. However, it didn't
        occur to him that perhaps taking individual towels off the roll and using them to clean would be the most efficient way to do it, so instead he opted to 
        turn it sideways and use it like a snowplow. I'll give you three guesses as to how well that worked, and the first two don't count. He then decided that 
        the best way to despose of the evidence of this failure (since behind the bathroom door was full of clothes and bathmats) was to flush the entire roll down 
        the toilet. </br></br>        
        The only think I can manage to think at this momemt is "WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. F."</br></br>
        I take it in for a moment before I spring into action. I throw Mike in the shower and turn it on so he can get cleaned up. While he stood in there wet and 
        whimpering, I fished the roll of paper towels out of the toilet and turned the water off so it would stop overflowing. I gathered up the clothes and mats in 
        a garbage bag -- there was no way I was salvaging any of that noise. Mike was right about one thing - he was damn well going to buy me a new one.</br>
        Try as I might, I couldn't get the toilet unclogged, so I gave up and vowed to call maintenance first thing in the morning (I was already trying to think of 
        a plausible story that might be less embarrassing than the truth, so I decided to tell them I had some REALLY bad Taco Bell). I got Mike in an acceptably clean 
        state and put him to bed.</br></br>
        <strong>Epilogue:</strong></br>
        About 7:30 the next morning, Mike managed to roust himself out of bed and started stumbling toward the bathroom. Knowing that the toilet was still clogged and 
        the water was turned off, I stopped him and told him to go in the apartment's other bathroom if he had to pee. He swore up and down that he wasn't going in there 
        to use the bathroom, so I let him continue. Not 2 seconds later, I hear PEEING. Being the wonderful, benefit-of-the-doubt giving person I am, I immediately 
        think: "That mother F***ER is peeing in the sink!"</br>
        And then I hear the unmistakable sound of attempted flushing. Son. Of. A. @*^)%*$@#!!!</br>
        </br>
        Cut to 4 hours later, Mike and I went to Target to buy new bathmats and a shower curtain.</br></br>
        Cut to 7 years later, we have been married for 3 years. Betcha didn't see that part coming, huh?
